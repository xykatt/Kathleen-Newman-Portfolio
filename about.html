                </h1>
                <p>
                    My name is Kathleen A. T. Newman, a Stockport, Greater Manchester-based Senior Level Technical
                    Writer, Manual Tester, Project Manager and Intranet/JIRA-Confluence Admin. I am a highly motivated
                    person who can work on my own or in a team. While in a team I like to organize my work and other
                    processes to make things run more efficiently for both myself and my team. I like to positively
                    motivate myself and others. I am very helpful and share information openly with others.
                </p>
                <p>
                    If you are in the market for an experienced IT professional, look no further. My track record shows
                    the ability to improve existing or established documentation and organizational methods. I have
                    excellent organizational and communication skills as well as being very social. I have experience
                    solving problems and supporting customers. I have the expertise you need to help you finish your
                    projects and deliver them on time with the highest quality. The information on this website can be
                    backed up and supported by: personal references, education, documentation, training courses, and
                    past experience. I also have the added benefit of being an all arounder since I also have experience
                    as a Manual Tester, Project Manager and Intranet/JIRA-Confluence Admin.
